# Web Applets

> An open SDK to create interoperable actions & views for agents â€“ _a web of capabilities!_

## What is it?

Web Applets is a specification for modular, local web software that can be read and used by both humans and machines. Web Applets aims to be an interoperabe application layer for agents â€“ instead of chatbots that can only interact in plain text, Web Applets allow them to actuate real software, read the results, and render rich, graphical views in response.

Did we mention it's _interoperable_? We think the future of software should be open & collaborative, not locked down to a single platform.

For more, see [why](./docs/why.md).

## Getting started

Install the applets SDK & CLI:

```bash
npm i --save @web-applets/sdk
npm i --save-dev @web-applets/cli
```

Then, initialize the `applets.config.json` and create a new blank applet:

```bash
npx applets init
npx applets create <your-applet-name>
```

This creates an applet folder, with a build system built-in using Vite. You can change this to anything you want. We recommend building at this stage, as the SDK currently needs to be bundled. We're working on adding a statically hosted script to import.

Inside your applet folder, you'll find a basic web app setup:

- `public/manifest.json`: This file describes the Applet, and tells the model what actions are available and what parameters each action takes
- `index.html`: Much like a website, this holds the main page for your applet
- `src/main.ts`: Declares functions that respond to each action, and a render function that updates the view based on state

> Want to use React? Svelte? Vue? â€“ No problem, just install the dependencies and create an app the way you normally would in a website. So long as you're receiving the action events, it will all just work.

Let's say we want our applet to respond to a "set_name" action and render the user's name. In our `manifest.json` file we can write:

```js
{
  // ...
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": "set_name",
      "description": "Sets the name of the user to be greeted",
      "params": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The name of the user"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Now let's update `src/main.ts` to assign an action handler:

```js
// First, import the SDK
import { appletContext } from '../../sdk/src';

// Now connect to the applet runtime
const applet = appletContext.connect();

// Attach the action handler, and update the state
applet.setActionHandler('set_name', ({ name }) => {
  applet.setState({ name });
});
```

When this state updates, it will inform the client which can then store the state somewhere, for example in a database so the applet will persist between uses.

Finally, we need to render the applet whenever a render signal is received. Again in `main.ts`:

```js
// ...

applet.onrender = () => {
  document.body.innerText = `Hello, ${applet.state.name}!`;
};
```

Now if you run `npx applets playground`, you should be able to test out your new applet action directly. This applet will now work in any environment where the SDK is installed.

## Integrating Web Applets into your client

Using Web Applets is just as easy as creating them!

First, build your applets. By default, this goes into a folder called `dist/`, but you'll likely want to change this in `applets.config.json` to point to wherever you're serving public files from. For example, in a Vite project, edit this to be `./public`.

Then, run:

```bash
npx applets build
```

Now in your main app, you can import the applets client:

```js
import { applets } from '@web-applets/sdk';
```

Now you can import your applets from wherever they're being served from (note â€“ you can also host them anywhere on the web):

```js
const applet = await applets.load('/helloworld.applet'); // replace with a URL if hosted remotely
applet.onstateupdated = (state) => console.log(state);
applet.dispatchAction('set_name', { name: 'Web Applets' });
```

The above applet is actually running headless, but we can get it to display by attaching it to a container. For the loading step, instead run:

```js
const container = document.createElement('iframe');
document.body.appendChild(container);
const applet = await applets.load(`/helloworld.applet`, container);
```

To load pre-existing saved state into an applet, simply set the state property:

```js
applet.state = { name: 'Ada Lovelace' };
// console.log: { name: "Ada Lovelace" }
```

It may also be helpful to check available applets at a domain, or in your public folder. For that you can extract the applet headers from the App Manifest at the public root (`/manifest.json`), and see the available applets and a shorthand for the actions you can take in them. This is automatically created when you build your applets.

```js
const headers = await applets.getHeaders('/');
```

This headers object looks like:

```js
[
  {
    name: 'Hello World',
    description: 'Displays a greeting to the user.',
    url: '/applets/helloworld.applet',
    actions: [
      {
        id: 'set_name',
        description: 'Sets the name of the user to be greeted',
        params: {
          name: 'The name of the user',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  // ...
];
```

You can use it to present a quick summary of available tools to your model, and then decide on an applet and action to use.
